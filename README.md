# Sonar, a self-hosted music streaming service

## The General Idea
Project Sonar - a service that allows users to upload or import music from other services, share tracks and playlists with other users and play the tracks, all using the Web UI.

## The Module Purpose
Our module manages the user-track operations - creating and managing existing playlists, changing visibility of tracks and playlists to share them with other users.
